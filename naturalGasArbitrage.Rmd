# Business Use Case

The logistics associated with the trading of physical natural gas are complex. In simple terms, pipelines move gas from areas of excess supply to areas of excess demand. Locations where many pipelines connect are referred to as 'hubs'. Physical natural gas is priced at all hubs. These prices represent the cost of moving gas through the network of pipelines, hubs, and storage facilities.

When demand exceeds supply in a particular location, prices rise in relation to other locations and gas tends to be re-routed to high-demand points. Physical constraints that prevent gas from flowing to a particular location create price spikes. Conversely, in areas of excess supply, prices tend to fall.

Gas can typically only flow in one direction along a pipeline. The physical characteristics of the pipelines determine flow capacity. Maintainence along pipelines - for instance - creates capacity constraints that temporarily prevent gas from freely following over particular paths. Such constraints can create incredible volatility in gas prices.

Contracting to buy gas at one location and sell that gas at another location for more than the transportation and other costs results in profits. To run a profitable natural gas trading business, one must be able to understand the natural gas network.  

Graphs provide a very natural abstract representation for the network of physical natural gas hubs connected by pipelines. 

In the diagram below we represent 6 hubs connected by pipelines. The direction of gas flow is represented by an arrow.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(igraph)
dg<-graph.formula(hub1 -+ hub2,hub2 -+ hub3,hub3 -+ hub1,hub4 -+ hub1,hub5 -+ hub4, hub6 -+ hub5,hub4 -+ hub6, hub1 -+ hub5,hub4-+hub3)
plot(dg)
```

# Nodes, Relationships, and Attributes

Each hub is connected to at least one pipeline. The cost of trasporting gas from one hub to another is roughly the price spread between the quoted prices at the two hubs. 

## Nodes
We define each hub as a node in our graph.

## Relationships

Pipelines - which allow physical gas to flow from one hub to another - connect nodes. 

## Attributes/Properties

Each path from one hub to another has a particular associated transportation cost. We can imply these costs from traded prices at each hub. We define the difference in price between any two given nodes as the implied cheapest cost of transporting gas between the two hubs.

Pipelines typically flow in only one direction. The direction of flow is a property of the path between two hubs. 

# Data

## Raw Data

Natural Gas Intelligence (NGI), is one of the leading publishers of pricing data for physical natural gas. NGI also redistributes trade data associated with the ICE exchange.

We extract the most recent ICE day-ahead natural gas price report from the Natural Gas Intelligence (NGI) service website using the 'rvest' package:

```{r}
# load the rvest package
library(rvest)
# set the NGI URL
urlString<-'http://www.naturalgasintel.com/ext/resources/Daily-GPI/ICE.htm'
# open the session
htmlSession <- html(urlString)
# define output directory
outputDirectory<-'C:/Users/DerekG/Documents/R/IS607/Project_5/'
# define output file name
outputFileNameCSV<-'dayAheadNatGasICE'
# define the .csv output file name
outputFileNameCsvFull<-paste0(outputDirectory,outputFileNameCSV,'.csv')
# define the .RData output file name
outputFileNameRFull<-paste0(outputDirectory,outputFileNameCSV,'.RData')
# fetch the ICE day-ahead natural gas price report data
table <- htmlSession %>% html() %>% html_nodes("table") %>% html_table()
a<-table[[1]]
# extract the trade and flow dates
tradeAndFlowDates<-a$X1[1]
# make the header
header<-c(a$X1[2],a$X2[2],a$X3[2],a$X4[2],a$X5[2],a$X6[2],a$X7[2])
# extract the columns
hub<-a$X1[3:length(a$X1)]
highPrice<-as.numeric(sub('[$]','',a$X2[3:length(a$X2)],perl=TRUE))
lowPrice<-as.numeric(sub('[$]','',a$X3[3:length(a$X3)]))
avgPrice<-as.numeric(sub('[$]','',a$X4[3:length(a$X4)]))
chg<-as.numeric(a$X5[3:length(a$X5)])
volume<-as.numeric(sub('[,]','',a$X6[3:length(a$X6)]))
numberOfTrades<-as.numeric(sub('[,]','',a$X7[3:length(a$X7)]))
# bind the columns together
rawData<-cbind(highPrice,lowPrice,avgPrice,chg,volume,numberOfTrades)
# create data frame
data<-data.frame(hub,rawData)
# write data to .csv file for upload to Neo4j
write.csv(data,file=outputFileNameCsvFull,row.names=FALSE)
# write data to .RData file for quick use in R
save(list=c('data'),file=outputFileNameRFull)
# add a header for data table
colnames(data)<-header
```

The following table displays pricing information on physical fixed-price trades on ICE for Next Day physical gas for the first 10 of the `r nrow(data)` reported hubs:

```{r}
# create a table with sample data
knitr::kable(head(data,10),caption='Sample ICE day-ahead natural gas prices')
```

We use on the average price at each hub to determine the implied cost of transporting gas between hubs below.

## Preprocessing

First, we can determine each unique two-hub spread and compute the implied costs of transporting gas between any two hubs by taking the simple difference between the prices at the hubs:

```{r}
# create structure to store nat gas spreads
natGasSpreads<-{}

for (hub1Index in seq_along(hub)){
  # extract the name of hub 1
  hub1<-hub[hub1Index]
  # extract the average price of hub 2
  hub1Price<-avgPrice[hub1Index]
  
  for (hub2Index in seq_along(hub)){
    
    if (hub1Index != hub2Index){
      # extract the name of hub 2    
      hub2<-hub[hub2Index]
      # extract the average price for hub 2
      hub2Price<-avgPrice[hub2Index]
      spread<-hub1Price-hub2Price
      ratio<-hub1Price/hub2Price
      # store the hubs, prices, and spread
      natGasSpreads<-rbind(natGasSpreads,c(hub1,hub2,
        hub1Price,hub2Price,spread,ratio))
    }
  }
}
# create the spread data
spreadData<-data.frame(natGasSpreads)
# name the columns
colnames(spreadData)<-c('hub1','hub2','priceAtHub1','priceAtHub2','spread','ratio')
# count the number of spreads
nSpreads<-nrow(spreadData)
# define output file name
outputFileNameCSV<-'dayAheadNatGasICESpreads'
# define the .csv output file name
outputFileNameCsvFull<-paste0(outputDirectory,outputFileNameCSV,'.csv')
# write the .csv file
write.csv(spreadData,file=outputFileNameCsvFull,row.names=FALSE)

```

There are `r nSpreads` distinct natural gas spreads if we constrain the spread to the difference between just two nodes. 

Next, we extract a subset of the spreads. The following table shows all of the hubs spread against the 'Henry' hub:

```{r}
# find all of the spreads to the benchmark 'Henry' hub 
henryIndex<-spreadData[,1]=='Henry'
# create a table with the spreads to the benchmark 'Henry' hub
knitr::kable(head(spreadData[henryIndex,],10),
  caption='Sample ICE day-ahead natural gas price spreads')
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# define output file name
outputFileNameCSV<-'dayAheadNatGasICEHenryHubSpreads'
# define the .csv output file name
outputFileNameCsvFull<-paste0(outputDirectory,outputFileNameCSV,'.csv')
# extract the implied cost for moving gas from Henry hub to any other hub
impliedCost<-spreadData[henryIndex,]
# write the .csv file
write.csv(impliedCost,file=outputFileNameCsvFull,row.names=FALSE)
```

# Queries to Acquire and Manage Data

Iterate over the hubs create the nodes and relationships using the R package, RNeo4j.

```{r}
# load the package
library(RNeo4j)
# set the connection parameters
graphURL<-'http://localhost:7474/db/data/'
userName<-'neo4j'
password<-'tgdnrx78'
# connect to the database 
graph = startGraph(graphURL,username = userName,password = password)
# clear the database
clear(graph,input=FALSE)
# find the henry hub
henryIndex<-hub=="Henry"
# extract the name of hub 1
hub1<-hub[henryIndex]
# extract the average price of hub 2
hub1Price<-avgPrice[henryIndex]
# define the node for hub 1
hub1<-createNode(graph,'hub',hub=hub1,priceAtHub=hub1Price)
  
for (hub2Index in seq_along(hub)){
    
  if (hub1Index != hub2Index){
    # extract the name of hub 2    
    hub2<-hub[hub2Index]
    # extract the average price for hub 2
    hub2Price<-avgPrice[hub2Index]
    spread<-hub1Price-hub2Price
    ratio<-hub1Price/hub2Price
    # define the node for hub 2
    hub2<-createNode(graph,'hub',hub=hub2,priceAtHub=hub2Price)
    # define the relationship with properties
    createRel(hub1, "COST", hub2, cost = spread)
  }
}
```

# Queries to Access and Analyze Data

Query for the prices at the Waha and the TGT-SL hubs:

```{r}
# query for the prices at the Waha and TGT-SL hubs
priceAtWahaTGT<-cypher(graph,"MATCH n WHERE n.hub IN {hubs} RETURN n.hub, n.priceAtHub",
       hubs = c('Waha','TGT-SL'))
knitr::kable(priceAtWahaTGT,
             caption='Prices at Waha and TGT-SL Hubs')
```

Find the number of cost links between hubs (i.e., pipeline connections)

```{r}
# query for the number of cost links between hubs
nSpreads<-cypher(graph,"match (n)-[:COST]-(m) RETURN n.hub, COUNT(m) as nSpreads")

worst5NegativeSpreads<-cypher(graph,
  "match (n)-[:COST]-(m) WHERE n.hub <> 'Henry' AND n.priceAtHub<m.priceAtHub RETURN n.hub,m.hub,(n.priceAtHub-m.priceAtHub) as spread ORDER BY spread LIMIT 10")
# rename the columns
colnames(worst5NegativeSpreads)<-c('hub 1','hub 2','spread')
# create a table with the 5 most negative spreads
knitr::kable(worst5NegativeSpreads,
             caption='Excess Supply')
```

Query for the 10 most positive spreads:

```{r}
# query for the 10 most positive spreads
best5PositiveSpreads<-cypher(graph,
  "match (n)-[:COST]-(m) WHERE n.hub <> 'Henry' AND n.priceAtHub>m.priceAtHub RETURN n.hub,m.hub,(n.priceAtHub-m.priceAtHub) as spread ORDER BY spread DESC LIMIT 10")
colnames(best5PositiveSpreads)<-c('hub 1','hub 2','spread')
# create a table with the 5 most positive spreads
knitr::kable(best5PositiveSpreads,
             caption='Excess Demand')
```

# Conclusion

The graph database provides a very powerful approach to understanding the natural gas network.
